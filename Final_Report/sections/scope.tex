Generative Adversarial Networks are one of the hottest topics in Deep Learning right now. The applications of GANs are far ranging and immense. Creating Info-graphics from text, creating animations for rapid development of marketing content, generating website designs are to name a few. Our focus in this project is to implement a way to complete images of faces by generating the missing pieces using a GAN. 

\par\bigskip
This particular implementation of the technology would be immensely useful in a variety of circumstances. A few straightforward applications include face sketching of suspects in a crime using eye witness accounts, super resolution of CCTV camera footage to enhance faces, filling in of old degraded color photos, etc.
