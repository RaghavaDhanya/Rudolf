The broad objective is to use the existing Generative Adversarial Networks technologies to aid in the generation of human faces such that the GAN generated images is indistinguishable from the images of the real people used to train the network, i.e fake images should look very much real. This would be then extended to completion of faces, ie. reconstruction of facial features given a partial face.\par\bigskip
The internal specific objective would be to achieve the above said objectives using a ground breaking technology released in fall 2017, the Capsule Nets. The existing latest state-of-the-art GAN architectures use Convolution Neural Networks in their Generators and Discriminators. The CNNs are said to have the drawbacks as mentioned before, where they cannot understand orientation and spatial relationships unless they are extensively trained with all possible images. This major drawback is handled by Capsule Networks.
\par\bigskip
Using the CapsNet architecture into the Generator/Discriminator could improve these Adversarial Networks quite drastically. This mating of the revolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks along with the ground-breaking Capsule Networks, resulting in “Capsule Net GANs” is the overarching objective.
