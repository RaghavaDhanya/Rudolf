{\chapter{Scope}\label{ch:scope}}
Generative Adversarial Networks are one of the hottest topics in Deep Learning right now. The applications of GANs are far ranging and immense. Creating Infographics from text, creating animations for rapid development of marketing content, generating website designs are to name a few. Our focus in this project is to implement a way to complete images of faces by generating the missing pieces using a GAN. 

\par\bigskip
This particular implementation of the technology would be immensely useful in a variety of circumstances. A few straightforward applications include face sketching of suspects in a crime using eye witness accounts, super resolution of CCTV camera footage to enhance faces, filling in of old degraded color photos, etc.
