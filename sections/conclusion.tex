During the course of this project, we wish to replicate the results of the existing state-of-the-art in Generative Models. Using this as a stepping stone, we would like to incorporate a hitherto unexplored option in CapsNet for Generative Models. Our motivating assumption is that CapsNet would provide a performance improvement.We base this on the idea that it is more capable of understanding the variances in objects. This in turn should lead to lower data requirements during training of the model and consequently lower power consumption. 

\par\bigskip We wish to provide a comparison between our novel CapsNet-based approach and other implementations of GAN for the same task. We would like to implement a proof of concept by developing a application to complete incomplete images of human faces. This could later on be used in enhancement of hazy CCTV footage to identify individuals, which would be immensely helpful to law enforcement personnel.
